#1.A code does not run. You will need to make the Age input be casted as an int instead of a string
#1.B Code runes an inf loop. to fix this you will need to increment the variable by x amount each time 
#1.C Code runes fine
#1.D Code does not run. You will need to indent the print statement to make sure its in the for loop
#1.E Code does not run. you will either need to cast the input as an int instead of a string or make the 5 in the condiational a string by adding quotes
